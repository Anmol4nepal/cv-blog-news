 	 <h1>Phewa Lake:</h1>
	<p>One of the highlights of my trip was visiting Phewa Lake. Rowing across Phewa Lake to reach the Tal Barahi temple with the peaceful and calm environment was another one of those moments that is forever engraved in my soul. </p>

    <h1>Hiking to Sarangkot:</h1>
	<p> We also decided to visit the magical Sarangkot as a little trek and memory. Watching the sunrise over Annapurna from Sarangkot was truly unforgettable.</p>
